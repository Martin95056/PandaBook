# Data structures and algorithms 2015/2016 Software Engineering

## "An algorithm must be seen to be believed." Donald Knuth

As computer scientists, we learn a lot by experience. We learn by seeing how other people solve particular problems and by solving problems by ourselves. Being exposed to the influence of different problem-solving techniques, seeing how different algorithms are designed and how they work, helps us prepare ourselves to "fight" the next challenging problem, that we face. By considering a number of different algorithms, we can begin to develop pattern of thinking, so that the next time a similar problem appears, we solve it even better than the previous one.

The main goal of the course is to help you develop a sense for algorithms, make you feel them and believe in them as Donald Knuth has said.


###Repository's content
The repository will store all materials and tasks related to the Data structures and algorithms course for Software Enginnering at FMI, Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski" year 2015/2016.

Most, if not all, code snipets inside that repository will be written in Java. This will be tha programming language used for the goals of the course.
